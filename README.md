# KotOR-Autosplitter

## Description
This is a [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/) autosplitter made for *Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic*, made with the intention of giving the end user maximum configuration capability in where/when it will split. There are (currently) 3 releases:
1. **Full Configuration -** Allows absolute customization of where/when to split.
2. **Minimized (Any%) Configuration -** Allows customization of where/when to split, however many modules are removed (such as those not often seen in the Any% route), and the option to use unlimited splits has been removed.
3. **Basic Configuration -** Customization is limited to one split per in-game planet.
    1. **This is recommended for anyone who doesn't wish to use subsplits or the unlimited splitting feature(s).**

**All** versions have an implemented load remover, and *should* start at the proper time.

This autosplitter has not been tested with the old load remover, and as such is not recommended to be used in conjunction.
